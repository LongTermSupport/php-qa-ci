# PHPQA Laravel and Lumen

PHPQA will detect both Laravel and Lumen as part of the detect platform stage.

Laravel and Lumen specific configuration resides in [configDefaults/laravellumen](./../configDefaults/laravellumen)

Laravel and Lumen specific tools reside in [includes/laravellumen](./../includes/laravellumen)

The customisations are very light and generally the generic configuration and tools are used, the main difference being that Laravel and Lumen use an `app` folder instead of the more general `src` folder.
