In this folder you have 2 files that both acheive the same things, and one that does something different

## Code Styles

The first [jar file](./settings-code-style.jar) is a settings export that just contains code style.
The [XML file](./PHPQA_Code_Style_Scheme.xml) is just the code style edit itself.

## Template Settings

The second [jar file](./fileTemplates.jar) is a templates export file. It will set sane defaults for PHP and Bash files
