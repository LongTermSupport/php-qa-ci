# PHPQA

## Introduction

PHPQA is a quality assurance pipeline written in BASH that can be run both on the desktop as part of your development process and then also as part of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline.

It runs tools in a logical order and will fail as quickly as possible.

PHPQA has only been tested on Linux.
